	/**
	 * Accepts an object to be merged into the current state object,
	 * updating the values of specified keys to their specified values.
	 * 
	 * All specified keys must be present on the initial state object.
	 * This is a requirement of React hooks, as the number of calls to
	 * useState must be the same throughout a component's lifetime.
	 * 
	 * To dynamically add new keys to your state object, use a nested object,
	 * or use the {@link useMergedState | `useMergedState`} hook also exported by this library.
	 * 
	 * When called from inside a component class, the type of the object passed
	 * must be explicitly specified with a type assertion.
	 * This is because the component classes use the dynamic `this` type to define
	 * the type of their state property.
	 * 
	 * Use the `StateFragment` type, also aliased as `SF`, to define this type assertion.
	 * The assertion is not needed when calling putMany from outside the class.
	 * 
	 * @example <caption>Using `putMany`</caption>
	 * import type { SF } from '@cleanweb/oore/base';
	 * import { ComponentLogic } from '@cleanweb/oore';
	 * 
	 * class InputCL extends ComponentLogic<TProps> {
	 *     getInitialState(props: TProps): TState => ({
	 *         disabled: true,

	 *         this.state.putMany({
	 *             disabled: false,
	 *         } as SF<this>); // Type assertion required inside class.
	 *     };
	 * }
	 * 
	 * export const Input = (props: TProps) => {
	 *     const self = useLogic(InputCL, props);
	 * 
	 *     return <>
	 *         {
